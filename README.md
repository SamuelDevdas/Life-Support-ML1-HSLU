# Critical Care Patient Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 9,105 critically ill patients from various U.S. medical centers. Our aim is to use machine learning to improve end-of-life care decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/880/support2), encompasses a diverse range of medical and demographic variables. It provides a comprehensive view of patient care in critical conditions.

## Objectives
- To conduct a full-scale analysis using machine learning methods taught in class.
- Utilize models like Linear Models, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Model, and others.
- Focus on delivering insights that could be pivotal in critical healthcare decision-making.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Address missing values, encode categorical data, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine data distributions, correlations, and key patterns.
3. **Model Development**: Apply various machine learning techniques.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE for model comparison.
5. **Interpretation**: Provide a comprehensive interpretation of the findings and their implications.

## Tools
- **R Language**: Main programming language used.
- **R Libraries**: Including `caret`, `naniar`, `ggplot2`, etc.
