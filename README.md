# Predictive Analysis of Critical Care Costs and other Healthcare factors

## Overview

This repository contains the work of Pradip Ravichandran and Samuel Devdas, focused on leveraging machine learning methods to analyze and predict various factors affecting critically ill patients, particularly emphasizing the prediction of medical charges for life support patients. The dataset comprises records from 9105 critically ill patients across five U.S. medical centers between 1989 and 1994, sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/880/support2).

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop robust machine learning models that can accurately predict the medical charges for life support patients. This analysis serves key purposes in financial management, insurance processing, cost-effectiveness, policy making, and ensuring ethical, patient-centered care.

## Models

1. **Linear Regression Models**: Employed for understanding relationships between variables.
2. **Poisson Regression Models**: Used for predicting the number of comorbidities.
3, **Logistic Regression Models**: Used for predicting if patient died in hospital.
4. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Advanced modeling for pattern recognition.
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Utilized for classification and regression challenges.

## Installation and Usage

Detailed instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the models are provided in the respective folders.
